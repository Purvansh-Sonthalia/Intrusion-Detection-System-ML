# Intrusion Detection Systems using Machine Learning

This project explores Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), many more as well as their combinations to enhance classifier performance by reducing dataset dimensionality.

## Introduction

Reducing dimensionality with PCA can improve classifier accuracy by eliminating irrelevant features and minimizing overfitting effects.

## Key Insights

- **PCA Implementation:** Utilized PCA for relevant feature extraction.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** Combined PCA with Random Forest for effective classification.
- **Sensitivity to Noise:** Addressed noise challenges, particularly with PCA on noisy data.
- **Optimization Challenges:** Noted the importance of optimal principal component selection for classifier performance.

## Conclusion

Random Forest with PCA proves effective for detecting anomalies in noisy datasets. Highlights the significance of feature selection and noise management in machine learning models.
